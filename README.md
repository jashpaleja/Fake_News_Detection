# Fake News Detection

- **Project Title:** Fake News Detection
- **Project Location:** Project Based Learning, Personal Project, Jan 2022
- **Tools and Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

In this project, I implemented a Fake News Detection system using various machine learning models. Here are some key observations:

- Utilized word cloud visualization and conducted sentiment analysis to identify patterns and determine the emotional tone in news articles after cleaning data from null values and stop words.
- Attained exceptional accuracy scores, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 0.96. This was achieved by implementing machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines after vectorizing the data.
- Recognized the potential for future development, aiming to train and test the model using live data for real-life applications.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

1. `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the Fake News Detection project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. `news_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the Fake News Detection model.

## Usage

To use the Fake News Detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jashpaleja/Fake_News_Detection.git
   ```

2. Open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to explore the code, run the models, and analyze the results.

3. You can also use the `news_dataset.csv` dataset for your own experiments or to test the model further.

## Conclusion

The Fake News Detection project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to identify fake news articles with high accuracy. By following the key observations and repository contents, you can explore the project in detail and use it as a reference for similar tasks. This project has the potential for further improvements, especially when applied to real-life scenarios with live data.
